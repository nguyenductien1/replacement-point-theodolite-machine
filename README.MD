# These scripts are used to calculate the replacement of points observed by a station TOPCON in a given time period.
## Induction
### (Take place for induction later)
## Installation
### These scripts are written in Python 3. with the following external libraries: numpy;
## Usage:
### 1. I uploaded only the main calculate functions of the scripts to the GitHub repository. The other functions are not uploaded because they are used in project-specific and private.
### 2. You have to run the coor_init_points.py script to initialize the init coordinates of the points.
### 3. Then you have to run the deplacement_points.py script for calculating the replacement of point observed.

## Contents
### 1. coor_init_points.py
### 2. deplacement_points.py
### 3. TEST.cr300 this is a script to use on cr300 datalogger for collecting the data and take control the station TOPCON.
### 4. Test_STA3_RawData.dat this is an example of the raw data when the CR300 sent to server
